TIPS AND NOTES
Grammar notes will be more helpful once you have a context for understanding them, 
so if you find you're having trouble with the lessons, these notes should be more helpful to you.

SOME SIMPLE ESPERANTO RULES
Each letter has a unique and separate sound. For example: longa is pronounced "lon-ga". 
Both k and n are pronounced in knabo.

The emphasis in every word is always on the next-to-last syllable. 
For example: all 2-syllable words have the emphasis on the first syllable, 
as in viro, and all 3-syllable words have the emphasis on the middle syllable, as in knabino.

All present tense verbs end in -as, so there are no verb conjugations. 
Examples: estas, laboras. Yay!

All singular nouns, such as knabo and virino, end in -o. 
This includes names of cities and countries, such as Francio (France).

The definite article ("the" in English) is la in Esperanto. For example: la viro = the man.

Indefinite articles ("a" and "an" in English) are not used in Esperanto. 
For example: viro = a man.

-in is the feminine suffix: viro = man, virino = woman; knabo = boy, 
knabino = girl. Remember that all singular nouns end in -o, so the full ending is -ino.

ESPERANTO ALPHABET
The Esperanto alphabet has 28 letters. 
They include all the letters of the English alphabet, 
except for Q, W, X and Y. A few letters have accent marks.

If you are spelling an Esperanto word out loud, 
the name of each consonant is the sound that letter makes, 
followed by -o: B = bo, S = so etc. The name of each vowel is the sound that letter makes.
a   =   ah
e   =   eh
i   =   ee
o   =   oh
u   =   oo

The letters C and J
